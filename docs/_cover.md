# Quackage

> Building. Testing. Quacking. Reloading.

A CLI toolkit for managing, building, testing and documenting JavaScript/Node.js modules. Quackage wraps common tools behind a consistent command interface so every module in your ecosystem follows the same conventions.

- **Consistent** — One set of conventions for npm scripts, builds and documentation across all your modules
- **Automated** — Generate configs, run builds, prepare docs and scaffold projects from templates
- **Integrated** — Ties together Gulp, Mocha, Babel, Browserify, JSDoc, Indoctrinate and pict-docuserve
